# Interactive bouncing 3D wall pattern
Interactive bouncing 3D wall pattern that is activated while people walk by it.

## Summary

The plastic 3D wall pattern will have both clear holographic finish, which will transform light, and glow-in-dark finish. Ideally, the pattern can stands on it’s own and transform responding to the environment. 

Each unit of pattern will be connected by clear fish line. Motors will be placed on the top and the bottom of the pattern to control the movement. The goal is to make the mechanical parts blend in smoothly with the rest and become part of the visual design.  

Because the material quality of plastic, the model is highly flexible. With a little force added by the electronics, the pattern can transform into different shapes and therefore, transform the lights differently.  

I’m interested in people’s interaction in physical space. My ultimate goal of this pattern is to make it responsive with the environment, especially with people passing by. In short, it can transform, shrink vertically if people passing by or move in front of the pattern. One potential of this design is to create a wall that can breath based on the change of the environment. 

## Component Parts
Servo motor: 
(borrow from Hybrid Lab, buy if large power needed)
-pulling the fish line inside the pattern to make it shrink  

Structure:
-Create counter forces needed while pulling. 
-Make the pattern stable

3D pattern
-Strong and flexible at the same time
-Create interesting shapes both during pulling or without it. 

Clear Fish Line
- Organized to achieve the desire movement (make one layer of units move at the same 		time)
- Connects units horizontally
- Achieve pulling: Output

Camera:
(Borrow from Media Center) 
- Read movement in the environment :Input

## Challenges
-make the pulling movement right 

-Connecting the string can be time consuming

-Time management- it’s a big project and the time is very limited


## Timeline
- Week 1: Write proposal, make 1st version of the pattern + cardboard prototype
- Week 2: make the final version of the model + connecting the model with the motor
- Week 3: connecting camera to the design as input-make it interactive
- Week 4:debug
- Week 5: Present!
